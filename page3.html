                    Transportation Tips

                <div class="featured-destinations-content">
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                        <li>Use ride-hailing apps like Grab for taxis and motorbike rides. It's safer, cheaper, and
                            avoids
                            language barriers compared to hailing taxis on the street.</li>
                        <li>Negotiate fares in advance if you take a regular taxi or cyclo (three-wheeled bicycle
                            taxi),
                            especially in touristy areas.</li>
                        <li>Motorbike rentals are common, but always check the bike carefully before renting and wear a
                            helmet
                            at all times (it's required by law).</li>
                        <li>Traffic can be chaotic, especially in big cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Always
                            walk
                            carefully across the street â€” walk slowly and steadily so drivers can predict your movement.
                        </li>
                        <li>Public buses are cheap but may be confusing if you don't speak Vietnamese. Use apps like
                            BusMap
                            or
                            ask locals for help.</li>
                        <li>Domestic flights are very affordable if you want to travel long distances quickly (e.g.,
                            from
                            Hanoi
                            to Da Nang or Ho Chi Minh City).</li>
                        <li>Trains in Vietnam offer a scenic way to travel, especially the routes from Hanoi to Da Nang
                            (Hai
                            Van
                            Pass area is beautiful).</li>
                        <li>Be cautious with overnight buses (also called "sleeper buses") â€” choose reputable companies
                            for
                            better safety and comfort.</li>
                        <li>Electric cars and bicycles are available for rent in some cities like Hanoi, Da Nang, and
                            Hoi An
                            â€” a
                            great eco-friendly way to explore.</li>
                        <li>Carry small cash for public transportation like buses, motorbike taxis, or ferries â€” cards
                            are
                            rarely accepted.</li>
